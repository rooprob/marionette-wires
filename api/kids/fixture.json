    "descr": "Walter is a Muppet character that first appeared in the 2011 film The Muppets. Performed by Peter Linz, he is one of the central protagonists introduced in the film. During his adolescence, Walter frequently watched The Muppet Show, collecting memorabilia and finding the cast as a source of inspiration during his upbringing, which is why he often refers to himself as the \"worldâ€™s biggest Muppet fan\". While on vacation in Los Angeles, Walter assists the Muppets in regaining both their popularity with the public and control of their acquired studios from oil baron Tex Richman. At the conclusion of the film, Walter deduces that he is a Muppet, adopts whistling as his sole talent and joins the group as their newest member."

    "descr": "Zoot is a teal, balding saxophone player with dark glasses and a high-crowned blue felt hat, and was generally a laid-back fellow of few words. His name refers to the 20th century saxophonist Zoot Sims and per designer Bonnie Erickson, is modeled after Latin jazz artist Gato Barbieri. He is performed by Dave Goelz. He was conceived as a burned-out, depressed 50-year old musician, but according to Goelz, when the role was assigned to him, he did not know how to perform that type of character. He therefore made the character mainly communicate through his playing rather than by speaking."

    "descr": "Animal is the primitive wild man, drummer, and the most published member of the band, being the only member to have appeared in every feature film and the only member in the regular cast of the Muppet Babies spin-off cartoon. He is named for his wild behavior and drumming. Some speculate the character is based on either Keith Moon or Levon Helm while others have suggested Mick Fleetwood. In the April 8, 2002, episode of Inside the Actors Studio, Billy Joel claimed that Liberty DeVitto was the inspiration for The Muppets character Animal, but most others say there is no evidence he was based on anyone."

    "name": "Miss Piggy",
    "image": "piggy.jpg",
    "descr": "Miss Piggy began as a minor character on The Muppet Show TV series, but gradually developed into one of the central characters of the show. She is a pig, specifically, a mangalitsa who is convinced she is destined for stardom, and nothing will stand in her way. She has a capricious nature, at times determined to convey an image of feminine charm, but suddenly flying into a violent rage (accompanied by her trademark karate chop and \"hi-yah!\") whenever she thinks someone has insulted or thwarted her. Kermit the Frog is often the target of her alternating anger and affection. When not sending him flying through the air, she often smothers him in (usually unwanted) kisses. Frank Oz assigned hooks or personalities to each Muppet. Miss Piggy's hook was a \"Truck driver wanting to be a woman\"."
